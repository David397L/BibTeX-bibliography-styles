# bibliography-style-files
cseny.bst is a BibTeX bibliography style for the Council of Science Editors (CSE) name-year (ninth edition) citation style.
The development goal is to match as closely as possible the description of the style given at https://www.csemanual.org/Tools/CSE-Citation-Quick-Guide.html

Coming soon: csecn.bst, the "citation-name" version; and csecs.bst, the "citation-sequence" version
